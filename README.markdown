This repository is what runs http://cheatsheets.nickhammond.com, if you'd like to add a cheatsheet feel free to fork the repo and issue a pull request.

The cheatsheets use the blueprint css framework for the layout and all styles, see the blueprint site if you are not familiar with it.

### TODO 

* Generate pdf/image of cheatsheet since printers by default don't print cell background colors
* Standardize cheatsheet formatting and additions as much as possible
